## Step 4. Verify on GitHub

1. Open your repository
2. Refresh the page
3. Scroll to Screenshots section
4. If images do not show, your folder name or file name is wrong

GitHub does not guess paths. You must be exact.

## Hard truth

If your README has no screenshots, your project looks unfinished.
Recruiters judge in 5 seconds.
This fixes that instantly.

## Next level upgrade

Add a short GIF demo later.
That alone puts you above 80 percent of beginners.

If you want, send your repo link and I will optimize your README for internship and freelance clients.
